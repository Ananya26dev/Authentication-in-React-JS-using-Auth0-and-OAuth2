# Authentication in React JS using Auth0 and OAuth2

This project demonstrates how to implement secure user authentication in a React.js application using Auth0 and OAuth2 protocols. The app allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes by integrating with popular identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub through OAuth2. Auth0 simplifies user management, token-based authentication, and role-based access control.
